# **React Tuition Website**

This is a comprehensive React-based website developed for a tuition center. The platform is designed to facilitate smooth communication between potential students and the tuition center's administration. The website allows students or their guardians to fill out a detailed registration form for enrolling in various courses. Once submitted, the form data is stored in a secure backend database. The admin panel provides a powerful tool for managing these registrations, including the ability to view, edit, and print the data as a PDF.
